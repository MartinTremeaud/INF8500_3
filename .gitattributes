# Default Git attributes file autogenerated by SpaceStudio (TM).
# You may delete or modify this file.

# Default text merge of these files can be incorrect (e.g. lead to some element
# being duplicated because of two changes adding it in different locations
# of the file), so we disallow it.
#
# Note that this solution isn't perfect either ; this will only force two
# separate changes to these files to be considered a conflict and have to be
# merged manually. The ideal solution would be for SpaceStudio to have a
# custom merge driver, however that would bust our coffee budget.
#
# We still allow end-of-line conversions on checkout/checkin (so no '-text').
